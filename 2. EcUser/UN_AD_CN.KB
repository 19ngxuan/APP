container

question order.is.important

question last.in.first.out
is "Is the element added last the first to be taken out?"

question first.in.first.out
is "Is the element added first the first to be taken out?"

if order.is.important is no
and duplicates.are.allowed is no
and map.key.to.value is yes
then container is unordered_map

if order.is.important is no
and duplicates.are.allowed is no
and map.key.to.value is no
then container is unordered_set

if order.is.important is no
and duplicates.are.allowed is yes
and map.key.to.value is yes
then container is unordered_multimap

if order.is.important is no
and duplicates.are.allowed is yes
and map.key.to.value is no
then container is unordered_multiset

if order.is.important is yes
and last.in.first.out is yes
then container is stack

if order.is.important is yes
and last.in.first.out is no
and first.in.first.out is yes
then container is queue

if order.is.important is yes
and last.in.first.out is no
and first.in.first.out is no
then container is priority_queue
